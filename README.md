# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualization Using Pandas

![](https://github.com/kasturi-sahu/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/EDA.jpeg)

**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. 


1.  It includes cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis purpose.

2. The primary goal of EDA is to maximize the analyst's insight into a data set and into the underlying structure of a   data set, while providing all of the specific items that an analyst would want to extract from a data set, such as:

- A list of outliers  
- A good-fitting, parsimonious model  
- Estimates for parameters  
- Uncertainties for those estimates  
- A ranked list of important factors  
- Conclusions as to whether individual factors are statistically significant  
- A sense of robustness of conclusions  
- Optimal settings

**Exploratory Data Analysis** is majorly performed using the following methods and to ask the right questions

1.	**Univariate visualization/analysis** — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set. 

2.	**Bivariate visualization/analysis** — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest. 

3.	Similarly, we can also do **Multivariate or multithemed analysis**.

4.	**Macro to Micro analysis** : A micro perspective focuses on the individual level, while a macro perspective focuses more broadly 


Here I have used a simple dataset **(IRIS)** and tried to show all the analysis and types of plotting using Python.


# Types of Plotting

On the basis of the number of variables you want to see relationship in between, plotting can be classified as:

  - **Univariate Plotting**
  - **Bivariate Plotting**
  - **Multivariate Plotting**
